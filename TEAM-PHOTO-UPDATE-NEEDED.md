## New Narrative Highlights

### Before (Technical/Informational):
> "European frameless construction isn't just about more storageâ€”it's about precision you can see and feel in every door, every drawer."

### After (Storytelling/Emotional):
> "When you slide open a drawer we've built, you'll feel thirty years of learning in that whisper-quiet motionâ€”that's the difference between furniture and heirloom."

### Before (Feature-focused):
- "Frameless Construction" - "No face frame means 15% more storage"
- "European Hardware" - "Soft-close hinges for lifetime durability"

### After (Story-focused):
- "The Whisper-Quiet Moment" - "When a drawer closes with barely a sound, you're feeling thirty years of perfecting the craft"  
- "Built to Outlast Generations" - "These aren't just cabinetsâ€”they're heirlooms waiting to hold your family's stories"

## Performance Impact
- Site compiling successfully with 1151 modules
- 8-step journey now includes personalized completion experience
- All narrative changes maintain technical accuracy while adding emotional resonance
